This is my Maze Game!

It is a JavaFX application game where the user can navigate through the maze using the WASD keys. 
Clicking on the screen allows the user to shoot fireballs in the direction of the click.
There are 10 random enemies that are created and randomly placed throughout the maze.
These enemies roam the maze randomly until they spot the user, then they pursue the user directly.
At the end of the game, a score is displayed that is a mix of the user health left, the number of enemies left, and the time it took to exit the maze.

There are 5 main files. The main application game is Maze.java, where the JavaFX is launched from. Then there are four instantiable classes for different objects.
These objects are Attackers, Navigator, Fireball, and Hedges.
